# Discord Bot - ChatGPT + DALL-E APIs

This is a simple Discord bot that uses the OpenAI API to let users in a Discord server use ChatGPT or DALL-E in their text chat to generate text or images

## Features
- ChatGPT text generation
- DALL-E Image Generation
- Basic Discord command handling

## Notes
This project is no longer maintained, I built it as a personal experiment while I was learning how to call APIs and experimenting with early AI technology
